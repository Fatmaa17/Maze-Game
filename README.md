### Project: Maze Game üïπÔ∏è
Maze Game is a simple console-based game where the player navigates a maze to reach the goal. The game is written in C# and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like object-oriented design, 2D arrays, and keyboard input handling.

## Features
- **Player Movement:** Move the player (`@`) using arrow keys.
- **Maze Boundaries:** Walls (`#`) block movement to prevent exiting the maze or passing through obstacles.
- **Dynamic Rendering:** The maze redraws dynamically with each movement.

## How to Play
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Fatmaa17/Maze-Game.git
   ```
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio or any C# IDE.
3. Run the program.
4. Use the arrow keys to move the player (`@`) and navigate through the maze.
5. Reach the bottom-right corner to win.

## Technologies Used
- **C#:** Core programming language.
- **.NET Framework:** Project framework.
- **Console Applications:** For simple, interactive gameplay.

## Code Highlights
- **2D Arrays:** Used to store and render the maze structure.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Includes interfaces, classes, and inheritance to manage maze objects (`Wall`, `EmptySpace`, and `Player`).
- **Keyboard Input Handling:** Uses `Console.ReadKey` to capture player input for navigation.
